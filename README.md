## Considerations ##
* This is a Sinatra app, so you can run it with `ruby app.rb` or with docker as described below.
* It is *not necessary* to configure the postgres database. It is already hosted on a remote server.
* Below you can see an example of a flow that you can follow to test the app. You can use raider id:8 and id:9 to test if you want.

## Run and Enjoy ##
* You can run the app with docker. Just run `docker-compose up` and it will be available on `localhost:4567`.
* You can also run it with `ruby app.rb` and it will be available on `localhost:4567`:
    * `bundle install`
    * `ruby app.rb`
  
## Test ##
* You can test the app with command $ `bundle exec rspec`
* You should have 14 tests and 0 errors (I hope)
